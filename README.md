# Shortest Path Finding

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Minimum Path Finding App
This Flutter application demonstrates a grid-based visualization of finding the shortest path between two points using a simple breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Users can interact with the grid to set a start point, end point, and obstacles, and then calculate the minimum path.

## Features
### Dynamic Grid Visualization:

- A grid of customizable rows and columns.
 Each cell is represented by a CustomBox widget.
### Interactive Design:

- Tap to set the "From" point (starting position).
 Tap to set the "To" point (destination).
 Mark cells as obstacles or reset them by tapping.
### Pathfinding Algorithm:

- Implements BFS to calculate the shortest path while avoiding obstacles.
 Displays the traversed path dynamically on the grid.
### Color Coding:

- Start Point: Blue.
- Destination: Yellow.
- Obstacles: Red.
- Path: Light green.
